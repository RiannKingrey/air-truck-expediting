# What is Air and Truck Expediting?


Air and Truck Expediting is a locally owned company. It has many years of experience. All of the employees have excellent driving records with great reviews. Without the use of expediting freight some companies would not be able to function. For example, the automotive companies would not be able to build cars if it was not for expediting freight, not only automotive, but also aviation companies depend on expediting companies like Air and Truck Expediting to make sure certain propellers and molds get to the correct destination without damages. A lot of expediting companies are Owner-Operator owned just like Air and Truck Expediting.

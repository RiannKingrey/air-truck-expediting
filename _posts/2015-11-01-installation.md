An Owner-Operator is a driver who owns and operates their own vehicle under a company's DOT number.
In order to become an owner-operator please call and talk to Tanya Kingrey to set up an appointment to see if you qualify. All drivers must take a drug test administrated at the doctors office payed for by Air&Truck. If fail to do so automatic disqualification to being an owner-operator. Drug test will be taken often without any warning.
